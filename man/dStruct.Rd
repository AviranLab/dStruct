}
\arguments{
\item{rdf}{Dataframe of reactivities for each sample.}

\item{reps_A}{Number of replicates of group A.}

\item{reps_B}{Number of replicates of group B.}

\item{batches}{Logical suggesting if replicates of group A and B were performed in batches and are labelled accordingly.}

\item{min_length}{Minimum length of constructed regions.}

\item{check_signal_strength}{Logical, if TRUE, constructed regions must have a minimum signal strength.}

\item{check_nucs}{Logical, if TRUE, constructed regions must have a minimum number of nucleotides participating in Wilcoxon signed rank test.}

\item{check_quality}{Logical, if TRUE, check constructed regions for quality.}

\item{quality}{Worst allowed quality for a region to be tested.}

\item{evidence}{Minimum evidence of between-group variation for a region to be tested.}

\item{signal_strength}{Threshold for minimum signal strength.}

\item{within_combs}{Data.frame with each column containing groupings of replicates of groups A or B, which will be used to assess within-group variation.}

\item{between_combs}{Dataframe with each column containing groupings of replicates of groups A and B, which will be used to assess between-group variation.}

\item{ind_regions}{Logical, if TRUE, test each region found in the transcript separately.}

\item{gap}{Integer. Join regions if they are separated by these many nucleotides.}

\item{get_FDR}{Logical, if FALSE, FDR is not reported.}
}
\value{
Constructs regions, reports p-values and FDR for them.
